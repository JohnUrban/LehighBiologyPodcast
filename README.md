# LehighBiologyPodcast
Contains links to the Google LM podcast, and a file to download if that does not work.

# Access via your personal gmail account

- You will likely need a personal google account. I was unable to access with my Carnegie account, for example.
- Give the page time to load the podcast.

# Download the file
If you are unable to access the Google LM link, then an alternative is to download/use the .wav file from Google Drive:

# Enjoy!
