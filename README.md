# LehighBiologyPodcast
This Github Repo contains links to the Google LM podcast, and a file to download if that does not work.

The podcast was generated automatically by AI (notebook.google.com) scanning faculty webpages located here: 
https://bio.cas.lehigh.edu/faculty-staff

This is just an example of how I would incorporate and encourage the use of AI in my courses to help students actively engage with provided online materials, including PDFs of lectures and primary literature.

# Access via your personal gmail account
https://notebooklm.google.com/notebook/a2864831-7fe3-4c25-ae6b-f3457bcb4217/audio 
- You will likely need a personal google account. I was unable to access with my Carnegie account, for example.
- Give the page time to load the podcast.

# Download the file
If you are unable to access the Google LM link, then an alternative is to download/use the .wav file from Google Drive:

# Further Exploration
The autogenerated podcast is a demonstration of the power of using Google Notebook LM models. If you could interact with the Notebook yourself, this is what you would see:

- Notice the prompt in the first image. I can ask it any question pertaining to the information given in faculty web pages.
- Also notice the automatically generated "Briefing Doc", "FAQ", and "Study Guide."
  - To further explore these auto-generated documents, I provided PDFs in the sub-directory, "auto-generated-education-materials".

# Enjoy!
